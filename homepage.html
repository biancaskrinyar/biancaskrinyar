   				<h1 >Academic / Writer / Event Organiser / Aspiring Entrepreneur</h1>
   				<br>
				<p>Inspired by the Renaissance concept of the polymath, I have been engaging in wide-ranging fields, including the academia, languages, web design, programme coordination, event organisation, script and fiction writing, journalism, film-making, krav maga, squash, skiing, snowboarding, etc. Besides regularly enhancing my skillset, I continuously seek ways in which I can challenge and deepen my knowledge. This is particularly important to me, as I wish to use my knowledge I gained through my education as a tool to raise awareness of social issues, and to establish connections between the arts, social activism and education. To achieve this, I am currently undertaking a Master’s degree at London School of Economics and Political Science in ‘Culture and Society’, Sociology.</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<h2>Academic</h2>
				<br>
				<p>I’m an academic, whose main aim is to study social issues, such as inequalities, identity formations, modes and distribution of power, migration, and social stratification through a wide, interdisciplinary lens.</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<h2>Writer</h2>
				<br>
				<p>I’m a freelance writer, contributing to various online university magazines on an ad hoc basis. I’m currently working on my blog, as well as my first novel.</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<h2>Event Organiser</h2>
				<br>
				<p>I’m a Programme Coordinator and Event Organiser. In the past, I organised various small-scale events, such as film screenings, poetry readings, meetings with film directors, panel discussions, and socials. With regards to large-scale events, I organised a week-long trip to the Berlin Film Festival, a company Halloween party for 150 people, a four-day long summer camp for about 100 students, a day-long festival for students and locals in Groningen, and a student theatre play, which attracted approximately 200 people. Currently, I am LSE’s Co-Head of the London Start-up Fair, the biggest student-led start-up fair in the United Kingdom.</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<h2>Aspiring Entrepreneur</h2>
				<br>
				<p>I’m currently working on launching my own start-up in the upcoming year.</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<h2>Constant Learner</h2>
				<br>
				<p>I constantly challenge myself and thrive for more. I learn new skills, new languages, new sports, and I join various projects to continually reinvent myself.</p>
