   		<h1> WRITER. EDITOR. EVENT ORGANISER.</h1>
  
		<p>I have been engaging in wide-ranging fields, including the academia, languages, web design, programme coordination, event organisation, script and fiction writing, journalism, film-making, krav maga, squash, skiing, snowboarding, etc. Besides regularly enhancing my skillset, I continuously seek ways in which I can challenge and deepen my knowledge. This is particularly important to me, as I wish to use my knowledge I gained through my education as a tool to raise awareness of social issues, and to establish connections between the arts, social activism and education. To achieve this, I am currently undertaking a Master’s degree at London School of Economics and Political Science in ‘Culture and Society’, Sociology.</p>
		
		
		<h2>WRITER.</h2>
	
		<p>I’m a freelance writer, contributing to various online university magazines on an ad hoc basis. I’m currently working on my blog, as well as my first novel. I also write short stories, flash fiction, and screenplays.</p>

		<h2>EDITOR.</h2>

		<p>In 2020, I joined the New Sociological Perspectives, LSE's graduate sociological journal, as an Editor. Between 2022-2024, I was the Editor in Chief of the Journal. In 2024, I joined the Ancillary Review of Books (ARB) as an Editor.</p>
		
		<h2>EVENT ORGANISER.</h2>
	
		<p>In the past, I organised various small-scale events, such as film screenings, poetry readings, meetings with film directors, panel discussions, and socials. With regards to large-scale events, I organised a week-long trip to the Berlin Film Festival, a company Halloween party for 150 people, a four-day long summer camp for about 100 students, a day-long festival for students and locals in Groningen, and a student theatre play, which attracted approximately 200 people. Currently, I am LSE’s Co-Head of the London Start-up Fair, the biggest student-led start-up fair in the United Kingdom.</p>
