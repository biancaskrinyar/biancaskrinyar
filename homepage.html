   		<h1>Academic / Writer / Event Organiser / Aspiring Entrepreneur</h1>
  
		<p>Inspired by the Renaissance concept of the polymath, I have been engaging in wide-ranging fields, including the academia, languages, web design, programme coordination, event organisation, script and fiction writing, journalism, film-making, krav maga, squash, skiing, snowboarding, etc. Besides regularly enhancing my skillset, I continuously seek ways in which I can challenge and deepen my knowledge. This is particularly important to me, as I wish to use my knowledge I gained through my education as a tool to raise awareness of social issues, and to establish connections between the arts, social activism and education. To achieve this, I am currently undertaking a Master’s degree at London School of Economics and Political Science in ‘Culture and Society’, Sociology.</p>
		
		<h2>Academic</h2>
	
		<p>I’m an academic, whose main aim is to study social issues, such as inequalities, identity formations, modes and distribution of power, politics of physical and virtual spaces, urban spaces and urbanisation, migration, globalisation, international connectivity and social stratification through a wide, interdisciplinary lens.</p>
		
		<h2>Writer</h2>
	
		<p>I’m a freelance writer, contributing to various online university magazines on an ad hoc basis. I’m currently working on my blog, as well as my first novel. I also write short stories, flash fiction, and screenplays.</p>
		
		<h2>Event Organiser</h2>
	
		<p>I’m a Programme Coordinator and Event Organiser. In the past, I organised various small-scale events, such as film screenings, poetry readings, meetings with film directors, panel discussions, and socials. With regards to large-scale events, I organised a week-long trip to the Berlin Film Festival, a company Halloween party for 150 people, a four-day long summer camp for about 100 students, a day-long festival for students and locals in Groningen, and a student theatre play, which attracted approximately 200 people. Currently, I am LSE’s Co-Head of the London Start-up Fair, the biggest student-led start-up fair in the United Kingdom.</p>
		
		<h2>Aspiring Entrepreneur</h2>
	
		<p>I’m currently working on launching my own start-up in the upcoming year, giving marginalised communities a voice.</p>
		
		<h2>Constant Learner</h2>

		<p>I constantly challenge myself and thrive for more. I learn new skills, new languages, new sports, and I join various projects to continually reinvent myself. Currently, I am learning Italian and web development.</p>
